# Carbon black
Used for grabbing data from hosts. It has not been tested thoroughly and the output isn't too good, so errors aren't unexpected.

# Usage:
First: Create a file called config.py consisting of the following:<br>

```python
url=""
api_key=""
```
Fill in the blanks where url is the full url for carbon black (no path).

* exfil.py <path> <computername>
* memdump.py <computername>

# Todo
* [DONE] Create baseline session
* [DONE] Exfil data 
* [Started]Â Memdump machine
* [!] Automatically analyze with Volatility (?)
* [!] Differentiate between unix and windows hosts in scripts.

## cb.py
Used to create sessions to the computername<br>

Add this to your constructor and you have a working session in self.session:<br>

```python
from cb import sensorhandler
self.sensorhandler = sensorhandler()
self.session = self.sensorhandler.find_session(self.sensorhandler.get_sensordata(computername))
```

## exfil.py 
Takes argument of a path (directory/file) and exports it to your local machine. There is no failcheck to see if the directory is big, so be careful with this one. If the directory doesn't exist it will give an error.

## memdump.py
Takes an argument of a machine, memdumps if there is enough room followed by downloading locally and deleting the memdump on the remote machine.<br>

Something to remember here:<br>
* Memdumps can be 2x the size of memory
* When using compression it takes a long ass time. If computer is local it might be faster to just transfer the file. (Up to 32gb+ for clients)
